# Testing Changes Locally
- Install Hugo extended and prerequisites as described here: https://gohugo.io/installation/ 
  - Note: I installed Go version 1.22.6 and Hugo extended version [0.125.7](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.125.7), the [current version 0.132.2](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.132.2) produced some errors when running `hugo server`. 
    - Hugo Extend v 0.125 is the version that is currently used /tested in the [Research Group template](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-research-group)  (see netlify.toml)
- Run `hugo server` in the top-level directory of this project
- Navigate to `localhost:1313`
