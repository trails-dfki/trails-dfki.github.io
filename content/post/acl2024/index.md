Researchers from the TRAILS project will present 3 papers, and additional 3 are presented by other researchers from DFKI's [Multilinguality and Language Technology](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology) and [Speech and Language Technology](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) departments.
