abstract: 'This paper presents the dfki-mlst submission for the DialAM shared task
  (Ruiz-Dolz et al., 2024) on identification of argumentative and illocutionary relations
  in dialogue. Our model achieves best results in the global setting: 48.25 F1 at
  the focused level when looking only at the related arguments/locutions and 67.05
  F1 at the general level when evaluating the complete argument maps. We describe
  our implementation of the data pre-processing, relation encoding and classification,
  evaluating 11 different base models and performing experiments with, e.g., node
  text combination and data augmentation. Our source code is publicly available.'
